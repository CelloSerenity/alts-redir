# AltSource Redirector

A tiny, single-file static page that turns an AltSource URL into one‑click protocol links for a few alternative app stores and clients. Use it when you want to let your users add a AltSource to their apps directly (instead of copying and pasting).

Live demo (GitHub Pages): https://celloserenity.github.io/alts-redir/

Disclaimer
----------
I have no control over who uses this page and am not liable for any pirated or fraudulent applications installed via links generated by this page, nor any damage said apps may cause. Just stay away from sketchy sources.

Caution: AltSources including question marks (?) and/or ampersands (&) may encounter issues. I'll look into fixing it if I actually hear of anyone being affected.

What this repo contains
-----------------------
- index.html — a lightweight, mobile-friendly single-page HTML app that:
  - accepts a source URL (via query parameter or paste input),
  - normalizes the URL,
  - generates one-click protocol links for supported clients,
  - can hide selected clients via the `exclude` query parameter,
  - offers "Copy source URL" and "View source data" actions.

How it works
------------
1. The page reads `?url=` from the query string. If no `url` is present it shows a form where you can paste the source URL.
2. The URL is normalized (leading `https://` is added if missing, whitespace trimmed).
3. For each supported client, a protocol URL is generated and routed via an HTTP redirector (based on [intradeus/http-protocol-redirector](https://github.com/intradeus/http-protocol-redirector)) so your browser attempts to open the custom protocol safely.
4. You can hide any generated client buttons using the `exclude` parameter.

Usage
-----
- Open the site and paste a source URL, or provide it directly using the `url` query parameter.

Examples
- Basic:
  https://celloserenity.github.io/alts-redir/?url=https://example.com/source.json

- With exclusions (hide Feather and LiveContainer buttons):
  https://celloserenity.github.io/alts-redir/?url=https://example.com/source.json&exclude=feather,livecontainer

URL parameters
--------------
- url (required when linking directly)
  - The source URL you want to open with a client. The page will attempt to normalize it (adding `https://` if missing and removing whitespace).

- exclude (optional)
  - Comma-separated, case-insensitive list of client names to hide.
  - Supported exclusion names:
    - sidestore
    - altstore
    - feather
    - livecontainer
  - Example: `&exclude=feather,altstore`

Supported clients (buttons generated by default)
------------------------------------------------
- SideStore — sidestore://source?url=...
- AltStore Classic — altstore-classic://source?url=...
- Feather — feather://source/...
- LiveContainer-Nightly — livecontainer://source?url=...

Notes and troubleshooting
-------------------------
- Some browsers limit or block automatic custom protocol launches; the redirector helps, but behavior varies across platforms and browser versions.
- If a client fails to open, check that the client is installed and that the platform supports its custom protocol.
- If a URL doesn't behave as expected, try pasting it manually into the form to let the page normalize it.

Security & privacy
------------------
- This is a static client-side page; it does not transmit any data except your source URL except when you explicitly use the redirector link to open a client.
- The redirector (based on an external project) is used to perform safe HTTP redirects to custom protocols.
