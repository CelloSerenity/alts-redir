# AltSource Redirector

A tiny static page that turns an AltSource (or other) URL into one-click protocol links for several alternative app stores and clients. This is useful when you want to open a package/source in apps that use custom URL schemes (e.g. SideStore, AltStore Classic, Feather, LiveContainer) and you want a simple browser UI or a shareable link that forwards through a redirector.

This repository contains a single-page static site (`index.html`) that:
- Accepts a source URL (via query parameter or paste input)
- Generates protocol links for multiple clients
- Optionally excludes specific clients via query parameter
- Copies the original source URL to clipboard and opens the original source in a new tab

## Features
- Simple, mobile-friendly UI
- Paste-from-clipboard button (requires user permission / gesture)
- "Copy Source URL" and "View Source Data" actions
- Query-parameter driven usage for direct linking / bookmarks
- Lightweight single-file HTML (no build step)

## How it works
- The page reads `?url=` from the query string. If absent, it shows a form where you can paste the source URL.
- It normalizes the URL and generates redirect links that point at an [external redirector](https://github.com/intradeus/http-protocol-redirector):
  - The redirector is used to cause the browser to attempt opening the custom-protocol URL via a safe HTTP redirect.
- You can suppress any generated buttons using the `exclude` query parameter.

## Usage
- Open the site and paste a source URL, or provide it using the `url` query parameter.
- Example (replace https://example.com/source.json with the real source URL):

  - Basic:
    https://celloserenity.github.io/alts-redir/?url=https://example.com/source.json

  - With exclusion (hide Feather and LiveContainer buttons):
    https://celloserenity.github.io/alts-redir/?url=https://example.com/source.json&exclude=feather,livecontainer

## URL parameters
- url (required when linking directly)
  - The source URL you want to open in one of the clients. The page will attempt to normalize it (adds `https://` if missing and removes whitespace).
- exclude (optional)
  - A comma-separated, case-insensitive list of clients to hide:
    - sidestore
    - altstore
    - feather
    - livecontainer
  - Example: `&exclude=feather,altstore`

Supported clients (buttons generated by default)
- SideStore (sidestore://source?url=...)
- AltStore Classic (altstore-classic://source?url=...)
- Feather (feather://source/...)
- LiveContainer (Nightly) (livecontainer://source?url=...)
