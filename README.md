# AltSource Redirector
A little webpage to redirect AltSources to your preferred sideloading application using [http-protocol-redirector](https://github.com/intradeus/http-protocol-redirector). Please don't use this to distribute pirated applications.

To use, append your AltSource (ex. `https://EXAMPLEALTSOURCE.com/apps.json`) after `https://celloserenity.github.io/alts-redir/?url=`, like so: `https://celloserenity.github.io/alts-redir/?url=https://EXAMPLEALTSOURCE.com/apps.json`.

I'm going to be honest, a lot of this is AI-generated. I'm sorry.
