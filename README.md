# AltSource Redirector

A tiny, dependency‑free static helper page for launching AltStore Sources (or AltSource) feeds in your preferred sideloading app. Paste or pass a source URL and quickly open it in SideStore, AltStore Classic, Feather, or LiveContainer — or deep‑link straight into an app using a single `r` parameter.

Live page: https://celloserenity.github.io/alts-redir/

## What it does

- Generates “Open in …” buttons for:
  - SideStore
  - AltStore Classic
  - Feather
  - LiveContainer
- Supports one‑tap deep linking via `r` (redirect) parameter.
- Provides convenient actions:
  - Copy Source URL
  - View Source Data (opens the feed URL in a new tab)
- Mobile‑friendly UI with safe‑area insets (great on iOS).
- Zero build step, zero external dependencies — just static HTML + JS.

>[!CAUTION]
>AltSource URLs including question marks (?) or ampersands (&) may encounter issues. I'll look into fixing it if it actually poses a problem for anyone.

## How it works

- If no query params are provided, you’ll see a simple form where you can paste a source URL.
- If `?url=…` is present, the page immediately renders buttons that will open that source in supported apps.
- Clicking a button navigates to `?r=…` where `redirect.js` immediately redirects the browser to the app’s custom scheme.
- If `?r=…` is present, the redirect happens immediately.

Files:
- `index.html` — UI, query‑param handling, and link generation.
- `redirect.js` — minimal redirect helper (based on [intradeus/http-protocol-redirector](https://github.com/intradeus/http-protocol-redirector)); reads `r` and calls `window.location.replace(r)`.

## Query parameters

- `url` (string, optional)
  - The source/feed URL (http/https). Leading/trailing spaces are trimmed.
  - If the scheme is omitted, `https://` is automatically prefixed.
  - Example values:  
    - `https://apps.altstore.io/`  
    - `apps.altstore.io` (becomes `https://apps.altstore.io`)
- `exclude` (string, optional)
  - Comma‑separated list of buttons to hide. Valid keys:
    - `sidestore`, `altstore`, `feather`, `livecontainer`
  - Example: `exclude=altstore,feather`
- `r` (string, optional)
  - A full URL (often a custom scheme) to redirect to immediately.
  - Used by the generated “Open in …” buttons and can be used directly for deep links.

## Examples

Using the hosted page at https://celloserenity.github.io/alts-redir:

- Render buttons for a source feed:
  - `https://celloserenity.github.io/alts-redir/?url=https://example.com/source.json`
- Render buttons, hide specific targets:
  - `https://celloserenity.github.io/alts-redir/?url=https://example.com/source.json&exclude=altstore,feather`
- Direct deep link to SideStore (immediate redirect):
  - `https://celloserenity.github.io/alts-redir/?r=sidestore://source?url=https://example.com/source.json`
- Direct deep link to AltStore Classic:
  - `https://celloserenity.github.io/alts-redir/?r=altstore-classic://source?url=https://example.com/source.json`
- Direct deep link to Feather:
  - `https://celloserenity.github.io/alts-redir/?r=feather://source/https://example.com/source.json`
- Direct deep link to LiveContainer:
  - `https://celloserenity.github.io/alts-redir/?r=livecontainer://source?url=https://example.com/source.json`

Note: The app schemes above are constructed exactly as this tool generates them.

## Security notes

- This page intentionally implements an “open redirect” behavior via `?r=…` so you can deep‑link into custom app schemes. Only share links from sources you trust.
- There is no tracking, analytics, or external requests in this repo. Clipboard access is user‑initiated (Paste/Copy buttons) and subject to browser permissions.
